Official Swag Lists is a project that aims to collect and organize information on official stores of companies and organizations, as well as third-party stores mentioned by those official stores.

## How to add a store

We provide instructions for both general users and engineers. Engineers should follow the engineer-specific instructions as much as possible.

### General Users

1. Send the name and URL of the store to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HoshimuraYuto).

### Engineers

1. Copy this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `pnpm install && pnpm dev`.
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/add-organization`. The port number may be different.
4. Enter each item. `Name`, `url`, and `Logo url` are required.
5. Submit a pull request.
